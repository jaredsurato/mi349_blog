            <p id="biography">
                I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year computer science student at MSU. I currently work for
                a small company on campus called ICER (Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research).
                I have a twin brother who is also an MSU student studying Civil Engineering.
                My fiancee and I live with two cats, Joe and Penny. I enjoy playing video games
                in my free time as well as the occassional DIY project. If I could live anywhere
                in the world I would want to live in New Zealand because that is where my favorite
                movies were filmed, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. If I could only eat one thing
                for the rest of my life it would be pizza because you can pretty much put <em>anything</em>
                on pizza.

                    I mainly play video games on my computer that I built. This is the second computer that
                    I have built. It is pretty powerful and allows me to play most games without having to worry
                    about performance.
                </p>
                <h4>The games that I play most are:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Battlefield 4</li>
                    <li>Escape From Tarkov</li>
                    <li>Arma 3</li>
                    <li>Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War</li>
